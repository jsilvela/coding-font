coding-font
===========

A coding font made of Fira Sans, with punctuation, zero and capital-i taken from Fira Mono.

I used FontForge on Debian to do this. I don't really know what I'm doing, so any
help will be much welcome.

I will be trying to find the situation regarding the name, license etc. Again, help welcome.
Called it Cira because I don't want to claim any sort of relationship with the team that made Fira.

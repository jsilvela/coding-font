coding-font
===========

A coding font made of Fira Sans, with punctuation, zero and capital-i from Fira Mono.

I used FontForge on Debian to do this. I don't really know what I'm doing, so any
will be much welcome.

I will be trying to find the situation with the name, license etc. Again, help welcome.
